<div class="about-text"><p>I am finishing up my third year at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, studying Graphic Communication with a concentration in Web and Digital Media.</p>

<p>I have worked for over a year at Accompa, Inc. as a Product Design Intern. Accompa's main products are enterprise software for requirements management and virtual idea boxes. Since I arrived, we have been branching out into mobile apps.</p>

<p>I began work on a dart scoring app called DartGenie shortly after being hired. My responsibilities spanned creating graphic and UI designs, developing marketing plans, writing requirements, managing the offshore development team, and testing the apps. The DartGenie app is available for iOS and Android, has more than 10,000 installs, and maintains a 4-star rating.</p>

<p>I am currently working on an app called Push the Hay, which is a logic puzzle game. I play a similar role on this project as I did on DartGenie. We hope to release this app by the end of May.</div>
